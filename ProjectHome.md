This module adds the SLIP protocol on top of the standard Python socket. This is one way of enabling message-based communication over TCP.

This module is intended for Python developers. It is useful in the following situations:

  * You need to implement an application that requires processes to exchange messages via long-standing TCP connections, and you are free to choose the method of message delimitation.

  * You are developing an application that must communicate with an existing application that uses SLIP over TCP to exchange messages.
